# Battleships

### Game Informant
I got the games rules and how its played through the wiki page of battleships and made all of the rules alone with how it would work in python.

There is a 10 by 10 bored and the user puts in the spot they picked to see if they hit or missed the computer ships after that the compiuter take a go at guessing and see if they hit or missed yor ship.

### code snip bits
I had help from chatGBT to make some of these features to see if both players hit a ship or missed
